# Flappy Bird Genetic Algorithm

### Goals
 - Learn about and implement `NEAT`
 - Research advantages of `NEAT` vs hand written Genetic Algorithm
 - Write a game!

### Frameworks
 - `NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)`
 - `Pygame`

### In Progress
 - Research advantages of `NEAT`
 - Implement Genetic Algorithm
 - Optimize game logic to allow training entire generation simultaneously
 - Visualize Neural Network structure

### Bugs
 - None at the moment!

### Done
 - Game logic with `Pygame`
